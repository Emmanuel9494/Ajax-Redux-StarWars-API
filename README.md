## **Introduction**
This project is a dynamic web application that utilizes the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to fetch and display character information interactively. When a character is selected, a lightbox appears, showcasing all the movies they appeared in. The application ensures a seamless user experience through smooth animations, error handling, and responsive design.

## **Features**
- **Character Selection:** Clickable character list fetching data dynamically from SWAPI.
- **Lightbox Display:** Interactive lightbox presenting all movies of a selected character.
- **Close & Reopen Functionality:** Users can close the lightbox and select another character.
