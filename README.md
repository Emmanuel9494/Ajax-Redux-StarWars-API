# Ajax-Redux-StarWars-API
This project is a dynamic web application that utilizes the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to fetch and display character information interactively. When a character is selected, a lightbox appears, showcasing all the movies they appeared in. The application ensures a seamless user experience through smooth animations, error handling, and responsive design.
